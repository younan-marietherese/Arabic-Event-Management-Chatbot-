**Arabic Event Management Chatbot**

Project: Developed an intelligent chatbot that can provide structured event recommendations 
and extract details about events from Arabic text input. Implemented a command-line interface 
in addition to a Gradio interface for user interaction. Sentiment analysis and feedback gathering 
were combined to assess and enhance the user experience. 

Key Contributions: 

• Used cutting-edge NLP algorithms to extract event data (Title, Date, Time, and Location) 
from unstructured Arabic text.  

• Using Gradio, an interactive user interface was created to improve usability and enable 
real-time involvement. 

• Used sentiment analysis to evaluate user satisfaction and added user feedback to improve 
results.  

• Designed and recorded an extensive report that included an analysis of the results, an 
overview of the problem, an experimental design, and practical suggestions.  

• Sentiment analysis tools, Gradio, Python, and NLP libraries (NLTK, SpaCy) were the technologies used.
